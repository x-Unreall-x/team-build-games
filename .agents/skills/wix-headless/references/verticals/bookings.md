# Bookings Pack

Loaded when the user's prompt implies offering appointments, classes, or sessions.

> **Discovery contract.** Phase 1 reads only the frontmatter above to compose the plan's Pages table. Phase 2+ implementation (seeding, page composition, theming) lives in this skill's own `references/astro/templates/bookings/` + `references/bookings/INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
>
> - Seed recipe: `<SKILL_ROOT>/references/bookings/SERVICES_DATA.md` (service creation via Wix Bookings REST API).
>
> No per-pack `seed`, `components`, `componentsCss`, or `pages` blocks live in this skill anymore.
