# Bookings Pages — the SSR routes (astro)

The `pages` scope of the bookings vertical. You write the route files. The
**logic** is in `../../bookings/FLOW.md` (read it first); this doc is the astro
wiring + the gotchas. Read `references/shared/IMPLEMENTER.md` +
`references/shared/STYLING.md` first.

> **Start from the templates — don't re-author the SSR data access.** Examples at
> `<SKILL_ROOT>/references/astro/templates/bookings/`: `ServiceCard.astro`,
> `services/index.astro`, `services/[slug].astro`, `booking-confirmation.astro`.
> Read and adapt (copy, headings, styling); keep the SDK query shapes.

## Pages you write

| File | From template | Role |
|------|---------------|------|
| `src/pages/services/index.astro` | `…/services/index.astro` | SSR catalog grid (SEO). `queryServices` via ambient `@wix/essentials`. |
| `src/components/ServiceCard.astro` | `…/ServiceCard.astro` | static service card for the grid. |
| `src/pages/services/[slug].astro` | `…/services/[slug].astro` | SSR detail (SEO) + mounts `<ServiceBookingFlow client:only="react">`. Also fetches the **booking-form schema** and passes `fields` to the island. |
| `src/pages/booking-confirmation.astro` | `…/booking-confirmation.astro` | confirmation — renders from the `service`/`startDate` query params (no re-fetch). |

Plus the nav/home links (shell chain — see below).

## astro-specific rules

1. **SSR reads use the ambient `@wix/essentials` client — never `OAuthStrategy`.**
   `const result = await auth.elevate(services.queryServices)({ query: { filter: { appId: BOOKING_APP_ID }, paging: { limit: 100 } }, conditionalFields: ["STAFF_MEMBER_DETAILS"] }).find();`
   Building `createClient({ auth: OAuthStrategy({ clientId: import.meta.env.* }) })`
   in frontmatter 500s in the deployed runtime (the env var is client-only).
   Always include **`appId`** in the filter. Single service by slug: the
   `.eq("mainSlug.name", slug).eq("appId", BOOKING_APP_ID).limit(1).find()` chain.
2. **The detail page fetches the booking-form schema server-side.** Read
   `service.form._id`'s form via `@wix/forms` (`auth.elevate(forms.getForm)(formId)`),
   map `formFields` to `{ label, target, required, componentType, identifier, options }`,
   and pass the array as `fields` into `<ServiceBookingFlow>`. **Filter to fields with a
   recognized string `componentType`** (`TEXT_INPUT`/`PHONE_INPUT`/`DROPDOWN`) — skip
   complex object-valued fields (e.g. the default form's multi-line `ADDRESS`), or
   `createBooking` fails with "must be object". Pass the full `service` too — the
   booking step reads its payment/policy. Same field-mapping as `../forms/CONTACT_FORM.md`.
3. **Only the read pages are SSR.** The detail page SSRs the service info for SEO,
   then the booking UI runs in the `client:only` island. Do not SSR availability.
4. **Confirmation renders from query params.** The booking step redirects with
   `?service=…&startDate=…`; render those. Do not re-fetch a stranger's booking
   from this public page.
5. **Two dirs deep** (`services/[slug].astro`) → import with `../../`, not `../../../`.

## Shell chain — nav + home (this scope patches shared files)

- **Navigation** — at `<!-- nav:links -->` in `src/components/Navigation.astro`,
  append a link to **`/services`** (label fitting the brand: "Book", "Services", "Appointments").
- **Home** — at `<!-- home:bookings -->` in `src/pages/index.astro`, add a short,
  brand-voiced CTA linking to **`/services`** (heading + a line + a button-styled
  link). Use the site's primary-action token (`--color-accent`). Do not list
  specific services or hardcode slugs — the catalog renders them live.
- Append at the markers; keep the markers; never replace other packs' insertions.

## Return
`{ status, phase, scope: "pages", summary, data, files, errors }`. Run the pre-return file-existence assertion (`../../bookings/INSTRUCTIONS.md`). If `index.astro`/`Navigation.astro` lacks its marker, return `status: "partial"` with the coded error.
