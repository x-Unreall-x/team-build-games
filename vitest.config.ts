/**
 * Tests are grouped PER GAME / area so each can run in isolation:
 *   npm test              → every main-tree suite
 *   npm run test:arena    → Arena (sim + netcode) only
 *   npm run test:members  → members-area helpers only
 *   npm run test:merch    → merch/print helpers only
 *   npm run test:squid    → Squid (sim + net + score helpers) only
 *
 * `exclude` drops build output, deps, and — importantly — git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/*`.
 * Those hold OTHER branches' full checkouts; without this, a `vitest run`
 * from the main tree also executes those branches' suites and reports their WIP failures here.
